## Overview
WbTstr is a test automation framework which makes testing the Web productive and hassle free. All major browsers are support, due to Selenium WebDriver that drives the core of WbTstr. On top of that we provide testers with a intuitive and feature rich API that allows complete automation of browser-based functional testing.
